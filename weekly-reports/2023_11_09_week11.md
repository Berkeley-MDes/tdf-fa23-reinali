### Reflection
#### Mini me final
We concluded the mini mi project for technical foundation, it was nice to see everyone else's work and I like how everyone assigned a unique tone to each of their AI system. From the feedbacks, I lot people liked the fact that I added emoji to the AI in order to make it sound like me, I also breka up the knowledge sets so it is able to register everything. I visited everyone's feedback for my video and a lot of them seems to be offering improvement on the video making skill. I think a big recommendation is to keep the screen larger, because the people in the back are not able to see it. Another suggestion was to tone down the background music or speak louder. I think in the future, I might use another video editing app like Adobe premier pro for ediing because I think Canva has quite a lof of restrictions.

I made a final PDF for subission for project 3, and it can be reviewed [here](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:va6c2:8f48fb2c-4048-4fb0-bae1-72c139859f38) for reference.
