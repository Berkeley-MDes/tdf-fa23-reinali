### Reflection
#### Mini me final
We concluded the mini mi project for technical foundation, it was nice to see everyone else's work and I like how everyone assigned a unique tone to each of their AI system. From the feedbacks, I lot people liked the fact that I added emoji to the AI in order to make it sound like me, I also breka up the knowledge sets so it is able to register everything. I visited everyone's feedback for my video and a lot of them seems to be offering improvement on the video making skill. I think a big recommendation is to keep the screen larger, because the people in the back are not able to see it. Another suggestion was to tone down the background music or speak louder. I think in the future, I might use another video editing app like Adobe premier pro for ediing because I think Canva has quite a lof of restrictions.In terms of context, I am grateful that people are able to understand my intention and I thought zerowidth is a really cool tool to play around. I think tge system did capture the essence of me pretty well, but not 100 percent exact, so it is just imporant to keep in mind. 

I made a final PDF for subission for project 3, and it can be reviewed [here](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:va6c2:8f48fb2c-4048-4fb0-bae1-72c139859f38) for reference. 

#### Brainstorming for project 4
As for the final, I want to work with wearable and incorporation sensors within, I want it to show a kind of identity or personal trait. As for the sensors I am working with, I was thinking biosensors， but I'm not sure what exactly I will be working on, more details coming out later. 

#### Studio project vessel
For studio, last week we came out with an innitial sketch, we are making a vessel for succulent. We also choose the material which will be acrylics and metal.

For this week, we are going to tackle all the acrylics part. Our plan in to laser cut it first, and then cut the angle on the table saw. We will strong glue them together and then weld it so the acrylics does not leak. We are going to do that for the actual vessel and the base pieces. Here are some of the processes.

For next week, we will finalized it and clad it with the metal strip around the vessel, we are securing it with nuts and bots. We are going to extract the templete from Rhino and then test it with paper first to make sure it fits. Then we are going to role the metal sheets with the roller from the CED shope and finalize the product. Here are the pieces of acrylics and the welding processes.

#### Manifesto composition
In terms of the manifesto, we are able to finish composing the visuals and the script. I am limiting each slide to about 11 seconds and correspond it with the appropriate visuals. The same idea is still as before. The feed back I received was that the script are clear, the visuals should be more organized and coherent for a story telling. Perhaps I could include visuals that has deeper layered of meaning. You can see my slides presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTu4vQNUcDPBj_QQPdnMtS_pyxjt-KK0mBqpZxt4azHMzuM1ijnDDIcSVCekae7Vg2ZGsP4fFIVJLzs/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=20000) if interested!

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
I believe that it could be used in the level of customization in engineering, particularly in the education sector, could be expanded. It can be offered as an assistant to generate specific knowledge that the user desires. For example, it could generate materials or tasks. Many people might also choose to use it instead of a search engine, as it provides a quicker way to obtain results. In terms of experiences I believe the LLM offers a lot of customization that can adapt to the user’s preferences. It can represent another human being to a certain extent, allowing people to have more natural conversations and increased interaction with machines and technology. Since it’s very user-friendly, I think many people might become reliant on it.

#### Future Direction my work
The future direction for my work will be aimed toward the final project. I am interested in combining the sensors from digital ecosystem unit along with some physical prototype. As of right now, I am interested in doing something with wearables. I thought the area is rather more interesting. I am not sure exactly what the product and thesis I am doing as of now, but I will come out with a specific one by next Monday. I am interested in doing and making with something that people could wear on the body along with sensors to detect.
