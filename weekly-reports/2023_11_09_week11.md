### Reflection
#### Mini me final
We concluded the mini mi project for technical foundation, it was nice to see everyone else's work and I like how everyone assigned a unique tone to each of their AI system. From the feedbacks, I lot people liked the fact that I added emoji to the AI in order to make it sound like me, I also breka up the knowledge sets so it is able to register everything. I visited everyone's feedback for my video and a lot of them seems to be offering improvement on the video making skill. I think a big recommendation is to keep the screen larger, because the people in the back are not able to see it. Another suggestion was to tone down the background music or speak louder. I think in the future, I might use another video editing app like Adobe premier pro for ediing because I think Canva has quite a lof of restrictions.

I made a final PDF for subission for project 3, and it can be reviewed [here](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:va6c2:8f48fb2c-4048-4fb0-bae1-72c139859f38) for reference.

For this week, we are going to tackle all the acrylics part. Our plan in to laser cut it first, and then cut the angle on the table saw. We will strong glue them together and then weld it so the acrylics does not leak. We are going to do that for the actual vessel and the base pieces. Here are some of the processes.

For next week, we will finalized it and clad it with the metal strip around the vessel, we are securing it with nuts and bots. We are going to extract the templete from Rhino and then test it with paper first to make sure it fits. Then we are going to role the metal sheets with the roller from the CED shope and finalize the product.
