### Reflection
#### Mini me final
We concluded the mini mi project for technical foundation, it was nice to see everyone else's work and I like how everyone assigned a unique tone to each of their AI system. From the feedbacks, I lot people liked the fact that I added emoji to the AI in order to make it sound like me, I also breka up the knowledge sets so it is able to register everything. I visited everyone's feedback for my video and a lot of them seems to be offering improvement on the video making skill. I think a big recommendation is to keep the screen larger, because the people in the back are not able to see it.

#### Manifesto composition
