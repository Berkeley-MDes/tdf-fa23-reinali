### Reflection
#### Software process
Our next step is connecting the data we get from the particle into an open processing drawing. We first chose a template we found on open processing and then added the generated URL and its associated code for each variable into the drawing from postman. When you click on the drawings, the list of data shows up. However, we thought that displaying the access token on such a public website might not be a good choice, so we decided to use Node.js and localhost. Basically, after setting up the npm and Express server, the JavaScript website allows us to interact with Particle devices to retrieve sensor readings. So when we open localhost, the exact information is there but just on its own website.

#### Wearable
The arm wearable holds the accelerometer and the pulse sensor. From the two iterations leading to my final design, the key features include adjustability for users to customize, flexible material, and placement of the pulse sensor right on the nerve to measure the pulse. The final design incorporates a box to hold the breadboard and sensors. 2 strap, adjustable according to user needs, wraps around the arms and connects with a loop strap, securing the pulse sensor at the joint of the upper and lower arms. The primary material used is 3D printed elastic resin, chosen for its flexibility and suitability for wearables

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
As for the future direction of the tool,  the generative art could be plug into with different sensors which I thought is cool. I think in different scenerios and it could represent a different graphic is a really cool ideda. It also can go beyond with sensors and be linked with other options. 
I am interested to see what other data could gererated art be used with, for example other hardwares as well.

#### Future Direction my work
In terms of the future direction of the work, I think we could do more drawings for different sports and using html to make it into a temporary website. 
- Collect Data for all athelete
- generate drawings base on data received
- Code and display all visuals into a website.
