### Reflection
#### Getting the accelerometer to work and publishing values
After preparing the accelerometer and pulse sensor code, I began by assigning variables to the sensor to ensure it publishes on the Particle Console website. In this case, it is easier to generate the URL in Postman, and I can include the URL in my JavaScript to retrieve information from Particle and assign the variables to each element in the p5.js drawing. I then started incorporting the url and values into the p5js drawings.

#### Software process
Our next step is connecting the data we get from the particle into an open processing drawing. We first chose a template we found on open processing and then added the generated URL and its associated code for each variable into the drawing from postman. When you click on the drawings, the list of data shows up. However, we thought that displaying the access token on such a public website might not be a good choice, so we decided to use Node.js and localhost. Basically, after setting up the npm and Express server, the JavaScript website allows us to interact with Particle devices to retrieve sensor readings. So when we open localhost, the exact information is there but just on its own website.

#### Wearable
The arm wearable holds the accelerometer and the pulse sensor. From the two iterations leading to my final design, the key features include adjustability for users to customize, flexible material, and placement of the pulse sensor right on the nerve to measure the pulse. The final design incorporates a box to hold the breadboard and sensors. 2 strap, adjustable according to user needs, wraps around the arms and connects with a loop strap, securing the pulse sensor at the joint of the upper and lower arms. The primary material used is 3D printed elastic resin, chosen for its flexibility and suitability for wearables

- The design should be adjustable, allowing users to customize it based on the parameters of their own arms.
- The 3D material should be flexible to ensure comfort on the arms.
- The pulse sensor should be positioned correctly and wrapped on top of the nerve.


#### Final outcomes and conclusion
We assigned BPM to the thickness of the rings and the accelerometer to dictate how large a ring can grow. As both pulse and acceleration increase, the size of the individual rings expands accordingly.When the use is in non active state, the pulse is relatively lower. The ring in the drawing is thinner and the overall Circle is â€œclosed.

On the other hand. when the user is in an active state, the pulse is relatively higher. The ring size is bigger and it is also more expanded.

**Conclusion** 
- Biosensor data into visualization using  p5js is interesting and allows a lot of creativeing..
- Publishing each sensor as  a variable so it is easier to incorporate in the actual code.
- Generating tokens using environment variable or tokens that is temporary
- Don't expose tokens to the public.

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
As for the future direction of the tool,  the generative art could be plug into with different sensors which I thought is cool. I think in different scenerios and it could represent a different graphic is a really cool ideda. It also can go beyond with sensors and be linked with other options. 
I am interested to see what other data could gererated art be used with, for example other hardwares as well.

#### Future Direction my work
In terms of the future direction of the work, I think we could do more drawings for different sports and using html to make it into a temporary website. 
- Collect Data for all athelete
- generate drawings base on data received
- Code and display all visuals into a website.
