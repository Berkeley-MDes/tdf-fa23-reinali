### Reflection
#### Grasshopper and Rhino
Last week, when I was building my final model in Grasshopper, I could not continue because of a certain technical error (I got lost assigning a boolean difference in grasshopper). I was able to resolve it after seeking help from the professor. After, I was able to boolean the difference between multiple numbers of spheres out the phone stand successfully. 
I am still continuing with the medium level, which involves baking the grasshopper file and modifying the parameter of the design, to create an object that serves as both a cell phone stand and storage components for jewelry, pens, and other small stationary objects. I prefer rounded shapes, which is why I thought it could be interesting to boolean differences spheres out of the phone stand. My design thinking was influenced by architectural projects, this case, the

I did some sketches for my initial ideas. I thought the intersection between the differences could be intriguing, especially when it interacts with materials and lighting. In addition, I think the boolean difference component could be used to store objects. I attached the grasshopper videos and pictures below. The sphere all intersect with one another.:+1: The first image is a video, you can click on the image and it will direct you to a youtube website.

#### 3D printing process
Initially , we tried to use the Prusa printer because it seemed the fastest way. We thought it will be easier because the queue for JPS was quite long. I combined my file with another classmate of mine (Kat) since spots are limited. Both of us exported the STL file through grasshopper and combined it in the cura app. We then switched to clear filament, because we thought it pairs with our design better.

The prints ended up failing when we tried to pick it up the second day. It printed about 30 percent of the design but was not able to generate even further. We made a mistake setting up the file, the filament was not evenly distributed but also the design needs a lot of support which I think there is not enough support generated. In conclusion, the prints ended up failing as seen in the picture below. The layers got messy as it built further up.

Everyone was trying to use the Prusa so we were not able to reprint using Prusa. So we decided to use form 3 to print our object. I chose the material in clean resin because I thought it could be pretty combined with lighting. After generating the right amount of support, I printed the final product like depicted below. We took the object out of the machine, then cleaned it as directed and removed all the support. The result is pretty close to what I imaged and I felt satisfied. It definitelly took couple trials and errors but eventually we are able to get it right. 

#### Grasshopper and Rhino
These are the final pictures of my 3D-printed phone stand. I ended up using the clear resin and used the Form 3 printer. Several classmates assisted me in the cleanup and curing process. The result is a phone stand, and the boolean differenced spheres could also enhance sound coming from the phone and ensure even distribution of sound to the surrounding area.

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
Like I concluded last time, I feel like grasshoppers could be used from product design to architecture and even landscape/urban development. I see it as an incredible tool particularly in architecture and construction, as it will provide precise measurement for engineers to construct the physical project. Through the 3D printing process, it also helped to identify the areas of the design that require support. It offered a more clear understanding of what can be built and areas of limitation due to gravitational forces. In addition, I think grasshopper is useful when working with curved shapes, it is easier to grasp the points in the x,y and z points. 

#### Future Direction my work
I was inspired by Cody’s lecture in which it was used in wearable devices, especially the dress that was 3D printed, I thought it was really innovative. I also wanted to explore wearable design. I thought it could be used in accessory products even, particularly working with modular structure - an area I wanted to explore further. In addition, the combination of 3D printing and material science could be an area of exploration.

I think the phone stand project served as a foundation and I really appreciate the project. By now, I think I can follow all the flow better from this exercise. I am also a lot more familiar with some commands and how to start a project using grasshopper. 

#### Interesting and relevant publications
https://www.alphamesh.de/en/
After seeing the dress from Cody’s lecture, the first example that popped into my mind was alphamesh. I don't think it is 3D printed, but it felt quite familiar. It is stainless steel but gives off a fabric texture. I thought the hard vs soft factor is so interesting and the material is so universal.
