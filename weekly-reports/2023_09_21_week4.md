### Reflection
#### Grasshopper and Rhino
This is my final week for the Rhino and Grasshopper project and I am combining all the process and deliverable into a PDF. I used Adobe indesign because I feel like it is a more organized way of constructing a final portfolio. This is the link to the final PDF.

#### Photon 2 set up
I first unboxed my kit and took out the photon 2 since that is what the assignment focuses on.

I did some sketches for my initial ideas. I thought the intersection between the differences could be intriguing, especially when it interacts with materials and lighting. In addition, I think the boolean difference component could be used to store objects. I attached the grasshopper videos and pictures below. The sphere all intersect with one another.:+1: The first image is a video, you can click on the image and it will direct you to a youtube website.
