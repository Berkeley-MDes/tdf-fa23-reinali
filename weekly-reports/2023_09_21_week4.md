### Reflection
#### Grasshopper and Rhino
This is my final week for the Rhino and Grasshopper project and I am combining all the process and deliverable into a PDF. I used Adobe indesign because I feel like it is a more organized way of constructing a final portfolio. This is the link to the final PDF.

#### Photon 2 set up
I began by unboxing the kit and extracting the Photon 2 microcontroller. To familiarize myself with the hardware, as it was my first time setting up something like this, I went through the slides on various aspects of the microcontroller. I then proceeded to create an account on Particle using my school email and registered my microcontroller as "reinasphoton." The name may be simple, but it's easy to remember and identify.
I then use the link [particle configure wifi](https://docs.particle.io/tools/developer-tools/configure-wi-fi/) and selected the wifi at my home. I simply connected it by enteringt he wifi passcode at my phone and started moving onto the next step.

I did some sketches for my initial ideas. I thought the intersection between the differences could be intriguing, especially when it interacts with materials and lighting. In addition, I think the boolean difference component could be used to store objects. I attached the grasshopper videos and pictures below. The sphere all intersect with one another.:+1: The first image is a video, you can click on the image and it will direct you to a youtube website.

Overall I don't think I run into too many hard problems because the tutorials are very detailed. I am really excited to work on this topic because it is definitely a skill that I have never touched on before. Even the examples that were shown in class seems super cool. 

### Speculation
