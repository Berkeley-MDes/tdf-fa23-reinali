### Reflection
#### Grasshopper and Rhino
This is my final week for the Rhino and Grasshopper project and I am combining all the process and deliverable into a PDF. I used Adobe indesign because I feel like it is a more organized way of constructing a final portfolio. This is the link to the final PDF.

#### Photon 2 set up
I began by unboxing the kit and taking out the Photon 2 microcontroller. It was my first time using hardware, so to familiarze myself with this this, I read through the slides on different parts about the microcontroller. I then went to the link in order to create an account on Particle using my school email and registered my microcontroller as "reinasphoton." The name is very simple, but it's easy to remember and identify.

I then use the link [particle configure wifi](https://docs.particle.io/tools/developer-tools/configure-wi-fi/) and selected the wifi at my home. I simply connected it by enteringt he wifi passcode at my phone and started moving onto the next step. 
It is time then to get my mac address. Opening up the [link](https://go.particle.io/shared_apps/6507d59801c67400099a4ce3) I then copied the app and the lights started flashing for a few minutes. I then realized that on the bottom right corner that my device is connected successfully, meaning it is all ready to move onto the next step! The step seems pretty straight forward and as of right now, I did not need to code anything because everything shows directly with the link.

Next step is to get my personalized code with [debug code](https://docs.particle.io/tools/developer-tools/usb-serial/) I just had to click connect, and then a chain of code showed up immediately. I took a picture of the page and also wrote down the code so I don't forget. I heard this code is extremely important. As of now, I finished setting up my photon 2 with my home wifi and is ready to go for the in class assignment happening on Thursday.

I did also complete the register for my computer address with the berkeley lot wifi section because the direction said that I can do it anymore. I just went to the berkeley wifi portal and created my new photon 2. I pasted my delug code and it generated a new Berkeley-IoT password specific for my device. I took a picture and uploaded it here for documentation. The process of setting up my Photon 2 runs pretty smoothly and I am all set for the next step.
