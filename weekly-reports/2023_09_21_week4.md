#### Grasshopper and Rhino
This is my final week for the Rhino and Grasshopper project and I am combining all the process and deliverable into a PDF. I used Adobe indesign because I feel like it is a more organized way of constructing a final portfolio. This is the link to the final PDF.

#### Photon 2 set up
I began by unboxing the kit and taking out the Photon 2 microcontroller. It was my first time using hardware, so to familiarze myself with this this, I read through the slides on different parts about the microcontroller. I then went to the link in order to create an account on Particle using my school email and registered my microcontroller as "reinasphoton." The name is very simple, but it's easy to remember and identify.

I then use the link [particle configure wifi](https://docs.particle.io/tools/developer-tools/configure-wi-fi/) and selected the wifi at my home. I simply connected it by enteringt he wifi passcode at my phone and started moving onto the next step. 
It is time then to get my mac address. Opening up the [link](https://go.particle.io/shared_apps/6507d59801c67400099a4ce3) I then copied the app and the lights started flashing for a few minutes. I then realized that on the bottom right corner that my device is connected successfully, meaning it is all ready to move onto the next step! The step seems pretty straight forward and as of right now, I did not need to code anything because everything shows directly with the link.

I did some sketches for my initial ideas. I thought the intersection between the differences could be intriguing, especially when it interacts with materials and lighting. In addition, I think the boolean difference component could be used to store objects. I attached the grasshopper videos and pictures below. The sphere all intersect with one another.:+1: The first image is a video, you can click on the image and it will direct you to a youtube website.

Overall I don't think I run into too many hard problems because the tutorials are very detailed. I am really excited to work on this topic because it is definitely a skill that I have never touched on before. Even the examples that were shown in class seems super cool. 

### Speculation
