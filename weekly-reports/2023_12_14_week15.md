### Reflection
#### Final
The final is the set up and jacobs showcase in order to present our project to the different people. Here is our set up with the physical prototype that people cna interact with as well as teh p5JS drawing. We had a live demo of people moving with the prototypes and seeing the drawing reacting to the data that is changing from the biosensors

#### Peer Feedback
I think most of the feedback we received was very positive; many people like the aspect we are trying to target, which is turning numbers into different drawings, giving each drawing a unique identity. Some other suggestions include connecting it with a big projector and incorporating sound effects, so each movement also has a sound that corresponds with it.
I believe utilizing the visual in a larger form is certainly interesting and could potentially be incorporated into a larger audience. For example, perhaps the visual could fill the screen, guiding the wearer to perform different actions, making the wearer feel more inspired. I think this is definitely the next step for us if we are developing it further.

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
The design technology also incorporates human experience because instead of numbers, the data we get from the sensors is turned into graphics, which are a lot less boring and more unique. Something we could consider is what people can do with the graphics. Perhaps individuals feel inspired by the drawing they receive when engaging in a certain sport, and they would like to save it or display it to guide them when repeating the activity, thereby recalling memories.

#### Future Direction of engineering
As for the future direction of engineering, generative art could be integrated with different sensors, which I find to be a cool idea. I believe that in various scenarios, it could represent different graphics, presenting a unique and innovative approach. Moreover, it can extend beyond sensors and be linked with other options. Incorporating visualizations with tools such as Grasshopper and Firefly could also have a significant impact on engineering. I think p5.js can be a great visualization tool to help engineers generate new ideas; the graphic solutions can inspire creative innovations.
