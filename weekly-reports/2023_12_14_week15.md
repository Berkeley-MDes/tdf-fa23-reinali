### Reflection
#### Final
The arm wearable holds the accelerometer and the pulse sensor. From the two iterations leading to my final design, the key features include adjustability for users to customize, flexible material, and placement of the pulse sensor right on the nerve to measure the pulse. The final design incorporates a box to hold the breadboard and sensors. 2 strap, adjustable according to user needs, wraps around the arms and connects with a loop strap, securing the pulse sensor at the joint of the upper and lower arms. The primary material used is 3D printed elastic resin, chosen for its flexibility and suitability for wearables

- The design should be adjustable, allowing users to customize it based on the parameters of their own arms.
- The 3D material should be flexible to ensure comfort on the arms.
- The pulse sensor should be positioned correctly and wrapped on top of the nerve.

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
As for the future direction of the tool,  the generative art could be plug into with different sensors which I thought is cool. I think in different scenerios and it could represent a different graphic is a really cool ideda. It also can go beyond with sensors and be linked with other options. 
I am interested to see what other data could gererated art be used with, for example other hardwares as well.

#### Future Direction my work
In terms of the future direction of the work, I think we could do more drawings for different sports and using html to make it into a temporary website. 
- Collect Data for all athelete
- generate drawings base on data received
- Code and display all visuals into a website.
