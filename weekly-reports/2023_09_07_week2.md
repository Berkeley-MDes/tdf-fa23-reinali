# Week 2 Progress Report- -09/07/2023

## Reina Li

### Reflection
Last week, I spent time laser cutting the template and made a phone stand. I briefly adjusted the perimeter to fit my phone; however, the overall shape remains unchanged. Here is a recap of the laser cut project from last week: I used one-quarter-inch thick wood, and the pieces fit perfectly into their designated slots.
