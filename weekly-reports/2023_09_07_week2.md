# Week 2 Progress Report- -09/07/2023

### Reflection
Last week, I spent time laser cutting the template and made a phone stand. I briefly adjusted the perimeter to fit my phone; however, the overall shape remains unchanged. Here is a recap of the laser cut project from last week: I used one-quarter-inch thick wood, and the pieces fit perfectly into their designated slots.

For this project, I decided to take on the medium challenge, so I am baking the Grasshopper model in order to generate geometry that aligns with my own design aesthetic. During class last Thursday, I experimented with the Boolean difference operation in Grasshopper and generated a phone stand in the shape of a semi-sphere. Here is a close-up of the Grasshopper file and the corresponding Rhino file. The phone stand now resembles a semi-sphere with a hollow in the middle for placing the phone on top.

During the class, I gained a better understanding of Boolean operations and creating shapes in Grasshopper. However, there were still some points that confused me, and I had to resolve them by searching for videos and tutorials online.
1. When I was trying to boolean differece the sphere from the table, there are many table elements in the Rhino file so I am still confused which one I should take.
2. Same thing to Brep table, there are many Brep table in the Rhino file. I was not sure which one to take
3. I am not sure why the red sphere is still present even though I formed another structure inside.
   
I believe I still need to apply the Boolean difference to the inner sphere, but I am not sure why the system is not subtracting. I plan to ask the professors on about this problem during class on Thursday, 9/7. Additionally, I don't think I successfully used the Boolean difference between the phone and the stand. The images shared above represent the progress I've made during class and my efforts over the past couple of days.
To proceed with the assignment, which involves baking the Grasshopper model and generating geometry, I am following the YouTube video that TJ shared on Slack. From the past classes, I got the basic commands, ideas, and ways to use Grasshopper, but I encountered several issues. The file is quite complex, making navigation challenging. If the file were simpler, I believe I could follow along more effectively.Through many trials and errors, I am getting familiar with it and have become more comfortable with Grasshopper.

### Assessment and Progress of Final Project 1
I've been putting in my best effort to follow the Grasshopper tutorial and incorporate my unique 'cave' design twist into the Rhino file. My approach involves using boolean difference operations with spheres inside the original phone stand design. However, I've encountered problems that's currently hindering my progress, and I'm unable to move forward.
1. I was not sure how to move the shape in a different axis. I did find the unit y, z command but I am not sure what it should be attaching to?
2. I am wondering if there is a command similar to boolean union in rhino so I can combine objects together.
3. I am not sure if my objects are actually subtracting.

With all these problems, I was unable to continue forward and had to consult with one of the professors in the next class. I did try my very best to continue as much as I could. 

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
I believe that Grasshopper and Rhino can be integrated with AI in the future to enhance their capabilities. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, incorporating Grasshopper into these tools will be beneficial. Currently, navigating complex Grasshopper files can be quite challenging (like the homework). AI has the potential to identify algorithms and generate design solutions based on user preferences. Additionally, I see great potential for Grasshopper in customization, like seen in the phone stand project. I discovered that Grasshopper can perform boolean difference or boolean union operations on objects without erasing previous versions. This was a new concept for me, as I had primarily used Rhino before. This feature in Grasshopper streamlines the design process, allowing designers to adjust parameters at any point in the project without the need for constant back-and-forth modifications.

#### Future Direction my work
My goal is to complete the entire stand by next week by 3D printing it. As you can see in the images attached to my reflection writing, I have already begun manipulating and altering the geometry within the Grasshopper files. My plan is to incorporate rounded shapes and use boolean differences techniques to create 'caves,' thereby achieving a more 'organic' form that aligns with my design aesthetic. For inspiration, I am referencing the interiors of iconic structures such as the Palais Bulles by Antti Lovag and the Organic House by Javier Senosiain

#### Interesting and relevant publications
[Here](https://www.3dnatives.com/en/what-are-the-advantages-of-using-grasshopper-for-3d-printing-100620214/) is an interesting article that I found that incorporates difference ways using grasshopper. I think it is especially important to intergrate grasshopper with repeated pattern or creating textures.
