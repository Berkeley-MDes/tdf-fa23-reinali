# Week 2 Progress Report- -09/07/2023

### Reflection
Last week, I spent time laser cutting the template and made a phone stand. I briefly adjusted the perimeter to fit my phone; however, the overall shape remains unchanged. Here is a recap of the laser cut project from last week: I used one-quarter-inch thick wood, and the pieces fit perfectly into their designated slots.

For this project, I decided to take on the medium challenge, so I am baking the Grasshopper model in order to generate geometry that aligns with my own design aesthetic. During class last Thursday, I experimented with the Boolean difference operation in Grasshopper and generated a phone stand in the shape of a semi-sphere. Here is a close-up of the Grasshopper file and the corresponding Rhino file. The phone stand now resembles a semi-sphere with a hollow in the middle for placing the phone on top.

During the class, I gained a better understanding of Boolean operations and creating shapes in Grasshopper. However, there were still some points that confused me, and I had to resolve them by searching for videos and tutorials online.
1. When I was trying to boolean differece the sphere from the table, there are many table elements in the Rhino file so I am still confused which one I should take.
2. Same thing to Brep table, there are many Brep table in the Rhino file. I was not sure which one to take
3. I am not sure why the red sphere is still present even though I formed another structure inside.
   
I believe I still need to apply the Boolean difference operation to the inner sphere, but I am currently unable to locate it. I plan to ask about this during the class on Thursday, 9/7. Additionally, I don't think I successfully used the Boolean difference operation between the phone and the stand. The images shared above represent the progress I've made during class and my efforts over the past couple of days.
To proceed with the assignment, which involves baking the Grasshopper model and generating geometry, I am following the YouTube video that TJ shared on Slack. I initially had a basic understanding of Grasshopper, but I encountered several issues. The file is quite complex, making navigation challenging. If the file were simpler, I believe I could follow along more effectively.Through many trials and errors, I have learned a few basic commands and have become more comfortable with Grasshopper.

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
#### Future Direction my work
#### Interesting and relevant publications
