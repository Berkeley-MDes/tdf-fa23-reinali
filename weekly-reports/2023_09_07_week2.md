# Week 2 Progress Report- -09/07/2023

### Reflection
Last week, I spent time laser cutting the template and made a phone stand. I briefly adjusted the perimeter to fit my phone; however, the overall shape remains unchanged. Here is a recap of the laser cut project from last week: I used one-quarter-inch thick wood, and the pieces fit perfectly into their designated slots.

For this project, I decided to take on the medium challenge, so I am baking the Grasshopper model in order to generate geometry that aligns with my own design aesthetic. During class last Thursday, I experimented with the Boolean difference operation in Grasshopper and generated a phone stand in the shape of a semi-sphere. Here is a close-up of the Grasshopper file and the corresponding Rhino file. The phone stand now resembles a semi-sphere with a hollow in the middle for placing the phone on top.
