### Reflection
#### Photon 2 exploration and output
During the first half of the week, our primary focus was on establishing communication between our photons. Initially, we attempted to create teams on the Particle website, but this approach proved unsuccessful. After multiple attempts, we made the decision to unclaim our devices and place them under the same account. now, both of our photons are now listed under my team name

Once this step was completed, connecting each device online is the next process. Although we encountered some difficulties when initially getting both of the photons online, we ultimately succeeded. Consequently, the devices are now effectively communicating with each other. Here are some of the code snippets and key moments that demonstrate successful communication between the devices.

We did face challenges when attempting to connect to the Wi-Fi simultaneously, possibly due to the high demand on the network with 60 students trying to connect at the same time

This is our final project in the video form.

#### Studio project final
This week, for our studio project, we are in the final stages of fabricating our design. Our project involves creating a compact shelving system using a combination of metal and wood, drawing inspiration from a reference project. Our 3D model includes a curved section influenced by Richard Serra's work. This is the original project we have to reference to.

In addition to this, we are incorporating a petal-shaped platform that was part of the original design. We have also rounded the metal cylinder to enhance the overall aesthetic.This is what we have now and we just have to screw the platfroms on and do some sanding after.

#### manifesto statement
We also wrote a tweet for our manifesto project for our video. The final video is suppose to be around 2 minutes but we are able to come up with a tweet this week. my tweet being "In the emergence of mimesis technology such as VR, has engendered a drift toward the ephemeral realm of dreams, causing an increasing detachment from the tangible community. Rather,  such technology should be advocated as a medium for rekindling a genuine connection with inaccessible aspects of our physical world, leading a paradigm shift in the concept of mimesis in design."
It seems quite dense so still editing for a bit. 
   
### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool

#### Future Direction my work

#### Integration with AI
This is a really advanced idea but it would be so cool if the owner can ask how the pet is doing, and there  is an AI generation summary basically highlightingthe overall health of the pet from looking at all the data input from the sensor.
