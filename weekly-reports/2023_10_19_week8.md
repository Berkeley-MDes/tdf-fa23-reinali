### Reflection
#### Photon 2 exploration and output
During the first half of the week, our primary focus was on establishing communication between our photons. Initially, we attempted to create teams on the Particle website, but this approach proved unsuccessful. After multiple attempts, we made the decision to unclaim our devices and place them under the same account. now, both of our photons are now listed under my team name

Once this step was completed, connecting each device online is the next process. Although we encountered some difficulties when initially getting both of the photons online, we ultimately succeeded. Consequently, the devices are now effectively communicating with each other. Here are some of the code snippets and key moments that demonstrate successful communication between the devices.

We did face challenges when attempting to connect to the Wi-Fi simultaneously, possibly due to the high demand on the network with 60 students trying to connect at the same time.
In our next class, we attempted to connect three sensors together. The pulse sensor served as the input, while the vibrator and display acted as the output. Our initial step involved finalizing the code for publishing. This entailed setting parameters for how frequently it updates, with the update interval being every 10 seconds. During these updates, it calculates and publishes the average heart rate. Here is the code we've developed for this purpose

Next, we focused on the subscribe part of our project, which handles the output. Our goal is to display the BPM on the screen along with its Heart Rate Variability (HRV). We configured the vibration setting to 100, so when the BPM exceeds 100, the device will vibrate. This is because our pet has a significantly lower heart rate compared to a human. To accomplish this, we incorporated both libraries and configured the parameters for the vibration
void myHandler(const char *event, const char *data) {

        toggleOled(data);
        if (std::stoi(data) >= 100) {
            // Particle.publish("Message",data);
            toggleVibrate();
        }
The vibration after working after numerous tries and adjusting the code. The only thing to note that is since we got the inexpensive pulse sensor, it does not give accurate reading for the heart rate, if you want an accurate reading of the HRVï¼Œdefinitely suggest getting a better HRV. Furthermore, sometimes the vibration is very soft, so also consider getting a stronger vibration sensor as well. In the end, we get everything to work and this is the final setup.

This is our final project in the video form.

#### Studio project final
This week, for our studio project, we are in the final stages of fabricating our design. Our project involves creating a compact shelving system using a combination of metal and wood, drawing inspiration from a reference project. Our 3D model includes a curved section influenced by Richard Serra's work. This is the original project we have to reference to.

In addition to this, we are incorporating a petal-shaped platform that was part of the original design. We have also rounded the metal cylinder to enhance the overall aesthetic.This is what we have now and we just have to screw the platfroms on and do some sanding after.

#### manifesto statement
We also wrote a tweet for our manifesto project for our video. The final video is suppose to be around 2 minutes but we are able to come up with a tweet this week. my tweet being "In the emergence of mimesis technology such as VR, has engendered a drift toward the ephemeral realm of dreams, causing an increasing detachment from the tangible community. Rather,  such technology should be advocated as a medium for rekindling a genuine connection with inaccessible aspects of our physical world, leading a paradigm shift in the concept of mimesis in design."
It seems quite dense so still editing for a bit. 
   
### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool

#### Future Direction my work
The project could be pushed further by examining the interval and standard deviation, I believe it has the potential to predict our pet's health for the next 10 minutes. We can enhance this by incorporating additional sensors such as sound sensors or motion sensors to monitor if the pet is exhibiting excessive movement, which could indicate discomfort or distress. In terms of the final object, we're considering 3D printing a clip that can be attached to the pet's collar for convenience.

#### Integration with AI
This is a really advanced idea but it would be so cool if the owner can ask how the pet is doing, and there  is an AI generation summary basically highlightingthe overall health of the pet from looking at all the data input from the sensor.
