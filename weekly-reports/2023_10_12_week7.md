### Reflection
#### Photon 2 exploration and output
For the project, we are using the HRV rate and predicting pet's health. So last week, we end up planning our idea and getting all the sensors. This week, our group divided up and each person will be testing a sensor since we need at least two sensors. We decided to test 2 sensors for input and 2 for output. We are using a motion sensor and heartbeat/pulse sensor as input, display and vibration as output. I am working on the display sensor as an output. I gathered all the materials needed for the display to work which incorporate the photon, a featherwing, the display and the wire that connects the display to the photon. Since the photonâ€™s output is different from the arduino, so then I have to solder it together, this is the final outcome.

I put that on the breadboard, and started getting my code ready. I had a hard time coming up with the code because I was not sure of the meaning of the code which I wish we could go over in class more. I did spend more than 4 hours just watching youtube tutorials on the ethics of coding and what each section means. After that, I imported the display library and copied a code in from the internet which displays a time and ended it up verified and to run.

I connected the wire with the featherwing and ran the code, but it did not light up. I was very confused since the code is right and the display is powered on as well. I thought I had to pin all the display holes onto the breadboard, so I ended up spending a lot of time doing that. Also did not work out. I ended up bringing it to class. After class, the professor double checked the code and told me it was because I did not put in the correct serial number. He told me it is very similar to an apartment number in which I have to double check that and put it in every time since it varies.  Now it is running, after many many hours. My teammate also ended up having the vibration and pulse sensor working so we will all come  together and have it work after that.

#### Studio project ideation
#### User research: Flow and interviews
#### Zine and starting Manifesto
We finished the zines making and research last week. The topic I picked was the evolution of Mimesis. I looked into its history and its uses through history including linguistic, product design and up to date's today's VR technology. I thought it could be an interesting area to look into my thesis while the idea is is my own creation an imitation of some sort? [Here](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-reinali/blob/main/weekly-reports/zine%20submit.pdf) is my zine in which I attached it for reference.
