### Reflection
#### Photon 2 exploration and output
For the project, we are using the HRV rate and predicting pet's health. So last week, we end up planning our idea and getting all the sensors. This week, our group divided up and each person will be testing a sensor since we need at least two sensors. We decided to test 2 sensors for input and 2 for output. We are using a motion sensor and heartbeat/pulse sensor as input, display and vibration as output. I am working on the display sensor as an output. I gathered all the materials needed for the display to work which incorporate the photon, a featherwing, the display and the wire that connects the display to the photon. Since the photon’s output is different from the arduino, so then I have to solder it together, this is the final outcome.

I put that on the breadboard, and started getting my code ready. I had a hard time coming up with the code because I was not sure of the meaning of the code which I wish we could go over in class more. I did spend more than 4 hours just watching youtube tutorials on the ethics of coding and what each section means. After that, I imported the display library and copied a code in from the internet which displays a time and ended it up verified and to run.

I connected the wire with the featherwing and ran the code, but it did not light up. I was very confused since the code is right and the display is powered on as well. I thought I had to pin all the display holes onto the breadboard, so I ended up spending a lot of time doing that. Also did not work out. I ended up bringing it to class. After class, the professor double checked the code and told me it was because I did not put in the correct serial number. He told me it is very similar to an apartment number in which I have to double check that and put it in every time since it varies.  Now it is running, after many many hours. My teammate also ended up having the vibration and pulse sensor working so we will all come  together and have it work after that.

#### Studio project ideation
For studio class, we  are starting the craftsmanship unit, in which we are in the fabrication shop. Each group is assigned to a project before in which we have to really mimic some influence from the project assigned and incorporate 2 more more materials in our project. Our group decided to draw correlation from their form in which there are repeated patterns and curved edges that look like  pine cones. This is the other group’s project.

I thought about creating a shelving system or even a wall hanger as a decoration. Here are some sketches and a quick Rhino 3D model I made. I am planning to go to the fabrication shop and talk to my professor about which one is a better option when it comes to more than 1 material as joinery.

#### User research: Flow and interviews
This week we are starting our final project for our User experience design class. In which we are doing problem statements, conducting interviews as well as writing POV statements. The problem we are solving is “At UC Berkeley, international students make up about 16.2% of the student body. Having taken courses with many international students, and some of us being international, we see a space of improved class participation for the international body. International students often hesitate to participate in class discussions due to concerns about their English accents and difficulties in articulating complex questions. Over time, this reluctance may lead them to become the “silent” ones in class, diminishing their self-value, as well as depriving the whole group of diverse perspectives. How can international students be encouraged to engage in more active participation in class settings?” We each interviewed an international student from different countries with different personalities and their comfortability with class participation and organized it onto miro, here is our affinity diagram.

The findings are very interesting, I think a very common theme we find is that people tend to not want to speak out thinking it is too basic and affending other people, so we generated our final POV statement being "International graduate students attending a U.S. university may benefit from a differently structured system that encourages safe environment building in order to adapt quickly and increase engagement among class discussions. This helps them adjust to novel environments in a low-risk context and receive more individualized feedback." We are will be then moving into our prototyping phases and developing a final project. We hope to use this project we came up to help more international student being more comfortable with class speaking, it is very intimadating for a new enviroment and it is especially relevant to us as a MDes community. 

#### Zine and starting Manifesto
We finished the zines making and research last week. The topic I picked was the evolution of Mimesis. I looked into its history and its uses through history including linguistic, product design and up to date's today's VR technology. I thought it could be an interesting area to look into my thesis while the idea is is my own creation an imitation of some sort? [Here](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-reinali/blob/main/weekly-reports/zine%20submit.pdf) is my zine in which I attached it for reference.
