### Reflection
#### Photon 2 exploration and output
For the project, our group divided up and each person will be testing a sensor since we need at least two sensors. We decided to test 2 sensors for input and 2 for output. We are using a motion sensor and heartbeat/pulse sensor as input, display and vibration as output. I am working on the display sensor as an output. I gathered all the materials needed for the display to work which incorporate the photon, a featherwing, the display and the wire that connects the display to the photon. Since the photonâ€™s output is different from the arduino, so then I have to solder it together, this is the final outcome.
