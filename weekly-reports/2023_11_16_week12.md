### Reflection
#### Final project process

#### Studio project vessel
For studio, last week we finished cutting and welding the acrylics part of the vessel. We started this week buy laser cutting the metal strips using Fablight. we used it because we need to cut curves and we also want to engrave patterns that shows a razzle dazzle pattern since we want to keep the design stype similar to deconstructivism. 
We then started by rolling the metal strips in order to form a circular helix around the acrylics. We secured the metal and the acrylics together using nuts and bolts since this is the more secure way of doing so. As a recap, we laser cut the acrylics and on the metal so it aligns. A challenge that we faced is getting the correctt radius for the helix because if too small or too big, the holes will not allign. Since the roller do not have an exact dimension that it could roll up too, we just have to try little by little at a time.
