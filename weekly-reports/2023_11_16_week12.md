### Reflection
#### Final project process
We start beginning of this week brainstorming ideation for final project, and I decided to do the final project as a continuation of project 2 in which we used hardwares and sensors for input and output. I was designing a device for pet wearable in which we used the pulses sesnor to test the pet's anxiousness, and set the normal HRV at a certain range. Once it goes beyond the certain range, it will trigger a vibration to the owner and a display of what exactly the BPM is. 
Trying to incorporate the sensors I am using because the codes are quite hard for me to do. 

**My new statement**: design an interactive wearable for athlete, using wearable as a silent communication tool to reveal the inner well being state of the athlete to the audience through the use of colors. EX: cool colors -relaxed state, and vibrant-high anxious moments. 
The project will use biometric sensors as the output: pulse sensor to measure heart rate and GSR sensor to detect the athlete’s physiological state and using RGB LED and connecting wires as output.

**Challenge Level:**  Axolotl

**Currently**: Right now I have experience working with the pulse sensor and lighting up the LED for the pet wearable. For the next step, I need to familiarize myself with the GSR sensor and program all the sensors together.

**Motivation:** I was interested in design and its integration with technology .The concept of performance design could be fascinating in positioning wearables as the focal point. Using them as a means to mirror the wearer, showing personality and mood transitions.Clothing is used as a way to possess the power to influence the atmosphere and environment. While the focus is still on the performance, untouched elements support the performer, making clothing one of the views. The design intention is to position wearable as a focal point of the project, unveil the different stages of performance. The interactive wearable is meant to mirror the weather;personality and mood throughout the entire performance. 

#### Studio project vessel
For studio, last week we finished cutting and welding the acrylics part of the vessel. We started this week buy laser cutting the metal strips using Fablight. we used it because we need to cut curves and we also want to engrave patterns that shows a razzle dazzle pattern since we want to keep the design stype similar to deconstructivism. 
We then started by rolling the metal strips in order to form a circular helix around the acrylics. We secured the metal and the acrylics together using nuts and bolts since this is the more secure way of doing so. As a recap, we laser cut the acrylics and on the metal so it aligns. A challenge that we faced is getting the correctt radius for the helix because if too small or too big, the holes will not allign. Since the roller do not have an exact dimension that it could roll up too, we just have to try little by little at a time.
