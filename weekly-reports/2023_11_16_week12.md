### Reflection
#### Final project process
We began brainstorming ideas for the final project at the start of this week. I decided to continue with the final project as an extension of Project 2, where we utilized hardware and sensors for input and output. In Project 2, I designed a device for a pet wearable that uses a pulse sensor to measure the pet's anxiousness. We set the normal Heart Rate Variability (HRV) within a certain range. When it goes beyond this range, it triggers a vibration to alert the owner, along with a display showing the exact BPM.I struggled with incorporating the sensors into my project because the codes are quite challenging for me. 

**My new statement**: design an interactive wearable for athlete, using wearable as a silent communication tool to reveal the inner well being state of the athlete to the audience through the use of colors. EX: cool colors -relaxed state, and vibrant-high anxious moments. 
The project will use biometric sensors as the output: pulse sensor to measure heart rate and GSR sensor to detect the athlete’s physiological state and using RGB LED and connecting wires as output.

**Challenge Level:**  Axolotl

**Currently**: Right now I have experience working with the pulse sensor and lighting up the LED for the pet wearable. For the next step, I need to familiarize myself with the GSR sensor and program all the sensors together.

**Motivation:** I was interested in design and its integration with technology .The concept of performance design could be fascinating in positioning wearables as the focal point. Using them as a means to mirror the wearer, showing personality and mood transitions.Clothing is used as a way to possess the power to influence the atmosphere and environment. While the focus is still on the performance, untouched elements support the performer, making clothing one of the views. The design intention is to position wearable as a focal point of the project, unveil the different stages of performance. The interactive wearable is meant to mirror the weather;personality and mood throughout the entire performance.

I had those final idea and pinned it on the wall, and I end up working with another member to complete my final project with one other member who has similar idea as me and look for our figma file  [here](https://www.figma.com/file/J2jBCbJ9QOSmvltg3QdGd7/TDF-Final?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=GdCysFfVLdlop3HK-1)
IN short, our final idea is creating a visualization of mind and the body. We are using pulse sensor, breathing sensor and accelometer to create a the input where we test yoga, running and normals people state of being. Our output will be a Grasshopper plug in for generative art. Before thanksgiving our goal is to.
- Information gathering and Figure out tentative plan
- Order Materials
- Draw Designs for prototypes
- Figure out code we need
- Recruit runner, yoga, rest testers
- Look up how to generative art with grasshopper/ try out the best plugins
- Find the code we need for sensors
- Brainstorm imagery we want to create
- Find videos on how to create generative art on youtube

#### Studio project vessel
For studio, last week we finished cutting and welding the acrylics part of the vessel. We started this week buy laser cutting the metal strips using Fablight. we used it because we need to cut curves and we also want to engrave patterns that shows a razzle dazzle pattern since we want to keep the design stype similar to deconstructivism.

We then started by rolling the metal strips in order to form a circular helix around the acrylics. We secured the metal and the acrylics together using nuts and bolts since this is the more secure way of doing so. As a recap, we laser cut the acrylics and on the metal so it aligns. A challenge that we faced is getting the correctt radius for the helix because if too small or too big, the holes will not allign. Since the roller do not have an exact dimension that it could roll up too, we just have to try little by little at a time.

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
As for the future direction of the tool, we will be testing out all the sensors and make sure to complete the code for all the sensors. The next step would be connect the sensors with particel like a fitbit devices and therefore measures the heartrate, breathing scale and skin temperature. We also need to test out different patterns on grasshopper and figure out what is best plugin for biosesnos and grasshopper. 

#### Future Direction my work
In terms of the future direction of the work, I highlighted out all the task we need to complete before thanksgiving. In terms of after thanksgiving, here are all the steps we are taking to achieve the final output. 
**Week 2:**
- Build physical prototypes
- Get initial data , map data
- Import data into grasshopper and create 1st images

**Week 3:** 
- Keep making art
- Make video
