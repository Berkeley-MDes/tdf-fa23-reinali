### Reflection
#### Final project process
our input is going to be an accelerometer, pulse sensor as well as a breathing sensor. Before and during Thanksgiving, we are all in charge of working different sensors. I mainly was in charge of combining the accelerometer and pulse sensor and I got the code ready, here is the combined code and this is going to be put on one photon. The other breathing sensor is going to be connected to the other photon and then we will make them talk and communicate with each other.

The code is finalized and it will be connected, our plan it logging it and here are some of our examples from the breathing sensors can be seen here. Since the hardware is done, we are also moving some of the focuses on working with open processing and how to connect the data of the particle with the open processing.

We then started working on open processing and generated a sketch based on some artists' ideas on open processing using p5js. The main consideration is how we connect the data with open processing. So by consulting with professors and some tutorials, I decided to move it to a local server at first. I made a html and edited the content inside forming a javascript file. Inside the javascript file is the code that is forming the generated art. Here is the code running on the local server.

The next step for it would be connecting it with the particle API so they will work well together. We aim to complete it by later this week.

We also started making some physical models for the project. We are thinking of making a 2 part wearable: a vest that connect with the breathing sensor and a cast around arm that is able to store the breadboard and the battery.So the first one I was thinking of making a cast, and I boolean  difference a rectangle in the middle where the bread board will be inserted, I think thinking I can clad that with some fabric inside. The second one is just more of a geometric box since the 3D printer won't let me print out a curved shaped box. Both will be print out using the flexible resin (bendable and good for wearables)

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
As for the future direction of the tool,  

#### Future Direction my work
In terms of the future direction of the work, I highlighted out all the task we need to complete before the end of the show, it is just about completion at this point. 
- Finalized physical prototypes
- connect the local server with particle API
- do the final presentation and prepare for showcase
