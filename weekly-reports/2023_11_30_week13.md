### Reflection
#### Final project process
our input is going to be an accelerometer, pulse sensor as well as a breathing sensor. Before and during Thanksgiving, we are all in charge of working different sensors. I mainly was in charge of combining the accelerometer and pulse sensor and I got the code ready, here is the combined code and this is going to be put on one photon. The other breathing sensor is going to be connected to the other photon and then we will make them talk and communicate with each other.

The code is finalized and it will be connected, our plan it logging it and here are some of our examples from the breathing sensors can be seen here. Since the hardware is done, we are also moving some of the focuses on working with open processing and how to connect the data of the particle with the open processing.

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
As for the future direction of the tool, we will be testing out all the sensors and make sure to complete the code for all the sensors. The next step would be connect the sensors with particel like a fitbit devices and therefore measures the heartrate, breathing scale and skin temperature. We also need to test out different patterns on grasshopper and figure out what is best plugin for biosesnos and grasshopper. 

#### Future Direction my work
In terms of the future direction of the work, I highlighted out all the task we need to complete before thanksgiving. In terms of after thanksgiving, here are all the steps we are taking to achieve the final output. 
**Week 2:**
- Build physical prototypes
- Get initial data , map data
- Import data into grasshopper and create 1st images

**Week 3:** 
- Keep making art
- Make video
