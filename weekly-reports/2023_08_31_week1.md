# Week 1 Progress Report- -08/31/2023

### Reflection
During the week, I spent time laser-cutting a phone stand for my iPhone 11 Pro. I also explored Grasshopper and Rhino. Below is my laser-cutted phone stand with my phone placed in the center. I am currently using it for my working desk at home.


While diving into Grasshopper, I have learned ways to adjust the dimensions/parameters of each piece of the phone to stand. The attached image shows me tweaking the components in order to fit my specific phone. Additionally, Iâ€™ve learned to read Rhino from the human perspective, which helps me to comprehend the user's viewpoint when utilizing the product.

On a more simple file, I also  have learnt how to create the central point as well as adjusting the parameter of a certain area. I attached an image below
