### Reflection
During the week, I spent time laser-cutting a phone stand for my iPhone 11 Pro. I also explored Grasshopper and Rhino. Below is my laser-cutted phone stand with my phone placed in the center. I am currently using it for my working desk at home.

While diving into Grasshopper, I have learned ways to adjust the dimensions/parameters of each piece of the phone to stand. The attached image shows me tweaking the components in order to fit my specific phone. Additionally, I’ve learned to read Rhino from the human perspective, which helps me to comprehend the user's viewpoint when utilizing the product.  I think exploring the cell phone stand as a procedural model is beneficial as a beginner level activity. The design is relatively simple to construct, although it requires the designer to adjust certain dimensions due to variations in sizes. I felt a sense of accomplishment that I have control over the degree of customization, allowing me to tailor the design to my own needs. The engagement and hands on practice in class also facilitate the knowledge into practical skills. Adding the human perspective viewport provided me to better develop a product that is human centric. The perspective is accurate and allows me to make necessary adjustments based on the viewpoint I see. I find this project comprehensible for beginning while also challenging in using new tools.

On a more simple file, I also have grasped the technique of creating a central point as well as modifying parameters for the file. The image below illustrates this process, where there is a center point in the middle. Also, l learnt how to switch colors for the base.

### Speculation and Consideration
#### What other contextual observations would be useful to capture?
I think materials and the environment in which users are located could also be important elements of contextual observation to capture. For materials, various materials react differently to temperature, humidity, sunlight, etc. As a example, metal would reflect light more than wood does. User scenarios are also important, the time of day can have different effects on the design. In the afternoon, users might face difficulty clearly seeing the screen due to direct sunlight affecting their eyes. 

#### What other evaluations of results would be useful to provide as feedback?
A big factor is usability. The ease of use of the product is a main consideration, especially when such an object comes to assembling components in the laser cut pieces. It is crucial to assess whether the assembly process is easy enough for the user to understand. Another factor is the product’s durability for the object that it supports. What is the maximum weight that the phone stand could hold? In Rhino, there is no assessment on physics in modeling, so providing insight to those aspects would be very helpful. 

#### Process involving AI
I think AI could be an assistance in running grasshoppers. For input, I think perhaps it could set up the user scenario through the algorithm it detects from its data analysis. It will be helpful using AI so they can analyze the temperature, and site condition in order to better assist the design to make adequate design decisions. 
For output: Maybe when the environment and materiality is applied, the AI could generate feedback in order for the designers to iterate the design. The area that works well as well as the area that needs improvement,with reasoning.
