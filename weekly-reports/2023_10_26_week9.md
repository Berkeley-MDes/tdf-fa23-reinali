### Reflection
#### TDF
We have completed the final report for Project 2. Over the weekend, I dedicated half of my time to reflect on my contributions, which I have now incorporated into the PDF. I've also compiled reports for all my tasks and submitted them on Canvas. You can refer to them using the following link.

In addition, we've initiated work on the LLM project, configuring software parameters. For instance, we can establish parameters and generate AI responses based on the course description. These tools are unique and enjoyable to work with, as they enable dynamic conversational interactions

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool

#### Future Direction my work
As of right now, I am not sure about the future direction of the work using this software. I feel like I have not had a full understanding of the topics and would like to learn more about the software and what it can be applued on in the next. As of right now, I just started understanding the software so not solid conclusion can be made at this moment.
