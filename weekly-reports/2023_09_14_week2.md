### Reflection
Last week, when I was building my final model in Grasshopper, I could not continue because of a certain technical error (I got lost assigning a boolean difference in grasshopper). I was able to resolve it after seeking help from the professor. After, I was able to boolean the difference between multiple numbers of spheres out the phone stand successfully. 
I am still continuing with the medium level, which involves baking the grasshopper file and modifying the parameter of the design, to create an object that serves as both a cell phone stand and storage components for jewelry, pens, and other small stationary objects. I prefer rounded shapes, which is why I thought it could be interesting to boolean differences spheres out of the phone stand. My design thinking was influenced by architectural projects, this case, the [Palais Bulles](https://www.lofficielusa.com/travel-living/pierre-cardin-palais-bulles-vacation-homeï¼‰

I did some sketches for my initial ideas. I thought the intersection between the differences could be intriguing, especially when it interacts with materials and lighting. In addition, I think the boolean difference component could be used to store objects. I attached the grasshopper videos and pictures below. The sphere all intersect with one another.:+1:
