### Reflection
Last week, when I was building my final model in Grasshopper, I could not continue because of a certain technical error (I got lost assigning a boolean difference in grasshopper).

I am still continuing with the medium level, which involves baking the grasshopper file and modifying the parameter of the design, to create an object that serves as both a cell phone stand and storage components for jewelry, pens, and other small stationary objects. I prefer rounded shapes, which is why I thought it could be interesting to boolean differences spheres out of the phone stand. My design thinking was influenced by architectural projects, this case, the [Palais Bulles](https://www.lofficielusa.com/travel-living/pierre-cardin-palais-bulles-vacation-home)
