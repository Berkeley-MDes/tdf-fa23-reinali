### Reflection
Last week, when I was building my final model in Grasshopper, I could not continue because of a certain technical error (I got lost assigning a boolean difference in grasshopper). I was able to resolve it after seeking help from the professor. After, I was able to boolean the difference between multiple numbers of spheres out the phone stand successfully. 

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
#### Future Direction my work
#### Interesting and relevant publications
