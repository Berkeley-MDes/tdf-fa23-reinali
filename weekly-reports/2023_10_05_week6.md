## Reina Li

### Reflection
#### Photon 2 set up and flashing on visual studio code
We spent the majority of Thursday setting up the visual studio code and copy and pasting in the code in order to flash the lights on the microcontroller. I was able to set up the extension of the workbench and site monitor without a problem. I was able to create a file in one of my folders in the drive and then sign in into my Particle Account. However when compiling it altogether and trying to flash it, it kept showing up as an error like attached below.

I consulted with several of my classmates that have knowledge in microcontrollers and we found out it is because of the file name path “Reina Li” which has a space in the middle. My classmates suggested that this is a problem. The solution could be solved by getting rid of the space and changing it all to lowercase. At first, we tried to sign out of the window account and make a new account, in order to change the file name in the other domain, however, the window computer still won't let me rename my own drive.
We ended up solving the problem when one of my classmates sent me another tutorial, basically adding in another administrator account and rename a couple of files there in order to rename the main domain name. It ended up working so I am attaching it [here](https://youtu.be/w5N2aaiToiQ?si=MUh35SYvr8ggipzg) if anyone needs for reference or run into the same problem as me. :smile: The microcontroller now is working and flashing like attached below.

#### Braintorming for photon 2 ideations
We then started to get into our groups and brainstorming different ideas for our topic. The topic I ended up landing is AI generated wearable for pet communication and training. My groupmate sent in a very helpful link that shows different cool projects that [particle microcontrollers](https://particle.hackster.io/projects) could do. We used it as a consideration since none of us really used microcontrollers before.
We used it as a guide to see what is doable with our kit and spent the majority of the time during the weekend brainstorming different ideas. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZoFp6oFhKmxBZ2buGV7A4CfgjSUUsxfi6jedMSN2474/edit) is our google docs for brainstorming as well as some details

We ended up choosing the Biosensor for observing heartbeat and detecting mood topics because it has the most potential and is the most relevent. Here are some reference

### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
#### Future Direction my work
#### Integration with AI
