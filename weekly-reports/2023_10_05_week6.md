### Reflection
#### Photon 2 set up and flashing on visual studio code
We spent the majority of Thursday setting up the visual studio code and copy and pasting in the code in order to flash the lights on the microcontroller. I was able to set up the extension of the workbench and site monitor without a problem. I was able to create a file in one of my folders in the drive and then sign in into my Particle Account. However when compiling it altogether and trying to flash it, it kept showing up as an error like attached below.

So I am attaching it [here](https://youtu.be/w5N2aaiToiQ?si=MUh35SYvr8ggipzg) if anyone needs for reference or run into the same problem as me. :smile:
