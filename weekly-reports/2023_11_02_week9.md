#### Studio project vessel
For studio, we started drawing the initial sketches of

#### manifesto draft
For the manifesto, we are composing the slides together, along with 15 seconds per slide. I created the images and the words I am saying along with it. My basic idea that I want to emphasize is Designers are replicating elements from the existing in the digital creation. Digital design is becoming too imitative and lacks originality. I pointed out that there are many digital designs that mimic real world objects, the concept was skeuomorphism. Then we call for designers to break free from the cycle of replication and embrace ambiguity in order to look for distinctiveness and innovation. You can see my slides presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTu4vQNUcDPBj_QQPdnMtS_pyxjt-KK0mBqpZxt4azHMzuM1ijnDDIcSVCekae7Vg2ZGsP4fFIVJLzs/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=20000) if interested!
   
### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
As for the future speculation for the tool, I think LLM could be a great integration with learning especially in the education sectors. From the exercise I am doing with the mini me, I realize as the more information I put in, the model becomes more personalized and tailored and sounds like me. In a learning setting, I think LLM can adapt to each userâ€™s needs and create different solutions that are suited for different kinds of learners in order to improve based on individuals. 

#### Future Direction my work
As for the future use of the product, since I have an interest in media and interactive design, I think it could be adapted into those immersive experiences as well. For example, based on what the user needs and they input it in the language model, the design could therefore react differently with different effects, environments and settings. I think that could be a cool tool to integrate together.s.
