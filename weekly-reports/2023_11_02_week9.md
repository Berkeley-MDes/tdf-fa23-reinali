### Reflection
#### Mini me final
After understanding the basic workflow, I started constructing the project by creating a welcome message that sounds like something I will say and then inserting my name so the AI knows is answering on my behalf.

This allows me to start the beginning stage of the mini me project. I had to keep revisiting the demo that Peter was doing in class on how to reduce the token in order for optimized solution. At first I tried to cram a lot of my information in the intelligence and instruction section, but then I realize that the response that the AI is generating takes way too long and is not specific enough. I rememeber to break it apart in the knowledge set sections. So for each of the component about my life, I decide to give further instruction there. Some includes growing up backgrounds, hobbies, education and many more. I realize the AI is generating better responses at this point. It is able to exact more detailed information after converting it into the knowledge set. As a result, I only created a short version on the instruction so it only shows my overall biography. The more detailed description about me are in the knowledge set as seen here.

I played around with instruction and the temperature in the LLM model in order to maximize the responses and realized that the project does not really sound like me. I reeddited the intruction area and made sure it start with well (because I use the word a lot) and adding a lot of emojis. Here are some of its results and it sounded a lot more like when I am texting. I think it is now able to hold a good conversation. I also divided all the informations into knowledge set so then it is able to retrive more acccurate information.

Base on all the adjustment that I made, I was able to form a conversation that I am proud of, here are some screenshots of my questions getting answered at its best ability.

The final video for project 3 is here!

#### Studio project vessel
For studio, we started drawing the initial sketches of our vessel. We decide to choose the pinwheel dessert rose, it is a tree succulent. As for the design, we are going to use acrylics and metal referencing to some deconstructivism artist such as Rem Koolhas and Frank Ghery. We decide to construct a hexagon shape in the middle and cut sheets of metal sheets, roll them and joint them on the surface of the hexagon shaped acrylics. We are using nuts and bolts to join the acrylics and metal sheets together. The radius of the metal sheets spiral will get bigger once it reaches the top, forming a more Advant Garde design.

#### Manifesto Draft
For the manifesto, we are composing the slides together, along with 15 seconds per slide. I created the images and the words I am saying along with it. My basic idea that I want to emphasize is Designers are replicating elements from the existing in the digital creation. Digital design is becoming too imitative and lacks originality. I pointed out that there are many digital designs that mimic real world objects, the concept was skeuomorphism. Then we call for designers to break free from the cycle of replication and embrace ambiguity in order to look for distinctiveness and innovation. You can see my slides presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTu4vQNUcDPBj_QQPdnMtS_pyxjt-KK0mBqpZxt4azHMzuM1ijnDDIcSVCekae7Vg2ZGsP4fFIVJLzs/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=20000) if interested!
   
### Speculation
#### Future Direction of the tool
As for the future speculation for the tool, I think LLM could be a great integration with learning especially in the education sectors. From the exercise I am doing with the mini me, I realize as the more information I put in, the model becomes more personalized and tailored and sounds like me. In a learning setting, I think LLM can adapt to each userâ€™s needs and create different solutions that are suited for different kinds of learners in order to improve based on individuals. 

#### Future Direction my work
As for the future use of the product, since I have an interest in media and interactive design, I think it could be adapted into those immersive experiences as well. For example, based on what the user needs and they input it in the language model, the design could therefore react differently with different effects, environments and settings. I think that could be a cool tool to integrate together.I also think it could be a cool idea to integrate that into my portfolio, but it would require coding activity.
