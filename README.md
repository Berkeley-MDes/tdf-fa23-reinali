# Hello!
Welcome to Reina's GitHub repository, where I compile my weekly report. As of now here are the weeks and link attached. 

## Week 1
## Week 2
## Week 3
## Week 4 (project 1 final): 




The specific file that I’m typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (💡 TIP: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (💡 TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis 😄</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>
